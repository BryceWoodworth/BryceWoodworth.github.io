I'm a computer science student with a love of theory, mathematics, and Artificial Intelligence.
Got a problem with anything I've said? Ways to improve algorithms or code that I've posted?
Let me know, I always enjoy constructive criticism. I also love learning new things, so if you
have suggestions or requests for areas I should look into, feel free to send them as well. 

Besides coding and math, I enjoy reading, running, and playing guitar. That about sums me up.
