title: The Worst Kind of Procrastination
---

I have been a student for a long time, and between myself and the peers I discuss such matters
with, we have studied for hundreds of years, written thousands of pages of essays, and
completed assignment after assignment after assignment. As is natural for one who has spent
so much time inside academic institutions, I have quite a bit of experience when it comes to
the topic of procrastination.

In this post I am going to focus on one particular situation in which procrastination arises,
which I will, perhaps somewhat melodramatically, dub 'the worst type of procrastination'.
As a decision-making agent, you have many potential interests and responsibilities that you
have to choose between when deciding how to spend your time. The circumstance I am referring
to occurs when these tasks can be generally grouped into the following three categories,
which I will later refer to by number in the interest of space:

1. Interesting tasks that you *want* to do (read a book, write a blog post...)
2. Shorter, mindless tasks that you *somewhat want* to do (browse facebook, watch a cat video...)
3. Boring tasks that you *have* to do (write a report, do homework...)

Given these options, we can conclude that both group 1 and 3 are worth doing. However, in general
there is a stress cost to leaving group 3 tasks uncomplete, and it is easier to enjoy group
1 tasks without the overhead. Additionally, group 3 tasks typically have more strict time
constraints for when they need to be completed, so any time that they are delayed
increases the likelihood that the remaining time will be insufficient to adequately
complete them (assuming we don't have perfect information about exactly how long each
task will take). As such, while there are still group 3 tasks left to complete,
any time spent doing group 1 tasks would be better spent on group 3 tasks. Group 2
tasks are both less productive and usually less fulfilling than group 1 tasks, so as
long as there are group 1 tasks, any time spend on group 2 tasks would be better spent
on group 1 tasks. As such, the most rational decision to maximize productivity and happiness
would be to prioritize 3 first, followed by 1, and only to default to 2 once no better
alternatives exist. However, as is often the case when confronted with an undesirable
but necessary task, the short-term cost of working on the task can eclipse the long-term
benefit, and procrastination ensues.

So far, this is procrastination in its most basic form, which if you are a normal person
is probably something you have ample experience with. However, we often go one step further.
Performing a task from group 3 is unpleasant so we delay it, which usually causes some level of
guilt.  This guilt can cause us to eventually loop back to finish the unpleasant task, which is
good, but it can also have the adverse effect that performing a task from group 1 causes even
more guilt and is no longer desirable, so instead we choose to spend time in group 2. This can
happen because tasks in group 1 tend to be more involved and time-consuming than tasks in
group 2, as well as the general perception that if you are going to be spending time
'being productive', you might as well be doing the group 3 tasks instead (but that won't
happen because you are procrastinating, so instead you will do neither). Regardless of the
cause, the effect is that the most unproductive, inefficient, and joyless option possible is
the one that is chosen. We prioritize group 2, even though it is less enjoyable *and*
less productive than group 1, all because we want to avoid group 3. This is what I refer
to when I use the phrase 'the worst kind of procrastination'.

Now, it is easy to see that such an outcome is undesirable and we should avoid it.
Conventionally, the 'solution' is to simply stop procrastinating and work on group 3.
This is appropriate advice in that successfully doing it will bring you back to the
optimal prioritization, but in general it doesn't work. Don't get me wrong, if you are
the type of person who can will yourself back into trudging through an unpleasant task,
then go watch some motivational music video or something and get back to work; that is
still the best option. For the rest of us, those who have tried time and again to break
the cycle of procrastination and have failed, I am going to offer some different advice.
I am going to argue that you should accept that you are going to procrastinate, and
procrastinate.

In 'worst procrastination' scenerios, you can achieve a much better outcome
if you simply accept that you are not going to work on group 3, and prioritize group 1
instead of defaulting to group 2. Unconventional, but it makes sense, doesn't it? You can
break the prisoner's-dilemma-style conundrum simply by not playing by the 'rules' of
procrastination-induced guilt. In this manner, you can work on interesting and challenging
tasks until the proximity to the due date causes enough stress to kickstart you back to
group 3, rather than wasting time.

This doesn't mean you should stop trying to break bad habits like procrastination - avoiding
procrastination is still more effective even than the improvement above - but if you
know in your heart of hearts that you are not going to write that essay until three hours
before it is due, then don't worry about it! Read a book, play an instrument, or work on
a personal project, just don't waste your time.
