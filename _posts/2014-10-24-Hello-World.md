title: Hello, world!

While this isn't my first foray into the world of blogging, this is going to be my first serious
attempt. I don't promise that I will post content here with any frequency, but I do
promise that anything I post will be the result of as much thought and consideration as feasible.
Any and all code, proofs, and views that I place here are my own and don't represent the views
or work of others unless explicitly stated.

Perhaps one day I will look back at this post as the beginning of a great and meaningful journey,
or maybe a significant waste of time. Who knows. For now, thanks for stopping by. I'll do
my best to make it worth your while in the future.
